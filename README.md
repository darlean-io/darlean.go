# Introduction

[Darlean](https://darlean.io) is an open source, cross-language library for creating distributed backend applications. It eliminates much of the
complexity that comes with distributed scalable computing (like inter process comunnication, scalability, concurrency, deployment and persistence) so that
engineers can focus on the actual domain logic.

Darlean is created to solve the [microservice premium](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html).
Instead of having to start a project as a complex (and expensive)
microservice project on forehand because it may grow in the future, or to start a project as a simple monolith at the risk of having to perform an expensive
rewrite when scalability or availability actually become an issue, Darlean makes it possible to start simple and to scale out when necessary with
zero or minimal changes to your application.

The library provides:

* [Virtual actor](https://darlean.io/the-virtual-actor-model/) primitives that are well integrated with the supported programming languages (currently TS/JS and Go).
* An [integrated high-performance message bus](https://darlean.io/documentation/configuration-options/#messaging-options) for inter-process communication (an external NATS message bus can also be configured).
* Integrated [scalable persistence](https://darlean.io/documentation/persistence/) (extendable architecture; external persistence providers can be used as well)
* Integrated [scalable indexed tables](https://darlean.io/documentation/tables/) (extendable architecture; external table services can be used as well)
* Integrated api gateways allow invocation of actors via HTTP/S.
* Persistent timers that invoke actors even when they are asleep.
